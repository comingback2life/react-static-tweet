## React Practise 
 This is the dynamic version of our static tweet application. 

  No user input is taken instead a user input is assumed by making an object called userTweet.

  It demonstrates the use of props. 

  Using React.createElements to create HTML tags.

## Takeaway from this version :100:
  The use of props and passing it through components
  
  The new level of nesting introduced in the like buttons and retweet buttons.
